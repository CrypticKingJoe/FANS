FANS is currently unusable at this stage in development! Make sure you watch this repository and check back every so often.

# FANS - Free Avatar Networking Script

I believe people should learn to code *for free* at an earlier age. Learning to maintain a website is perhaps the easiest way to get into computer programming. So as a result of this, I am developing an open source social avatar networking site with *no strings attached*.

## Modular

Visit the FANS Marketplace and download or upload new themes, avatar items, features and much more.

## Responsive

Mobile computers are becoming a more integral part of our day to day lives, therefore **all** websites should be compatible with every screen size. I am developing FANS with responsivity in mind to ensure it can be accessed from any device, no matter the screen size.

## Pure PHP

FANS' backend is coded in pure PHP. That means no frameworks. This tries in with my belief that young people should learn to code! If you learn to code in a framework, then you will find it increasingly difficult to switch frameworks or programming languages in the future.

## Modern Technology

The front end is developed in HTML5 and CSS3, whilst utilising JavaScript and jQuery to give the site a more interactive feel. For the database, FANS uses MySQL - the world's most popular open source database. 

## Earn Money

As stated in FANS' license, you may use the software for commerical use. This does **NOT** mean you can resell the software, but you can make money off the software (via upgrades, currency purchases etc). To emphasise this freedom, FANS comes with an optional upgrade system utilising PayPal and Stripe to automatically process upgrades for users who buy them.
